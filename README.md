# Lydsignaler
The code for the mini project of "Processering af lydsignaler (MED4, Aal)" together with a video showcasing how the script creates a GUI that works as an equalizer.

# Synthesizer Project

## Overview
This project is the implementation of an electronic synthesizer designed to generate and manipulate sounds electronically. The synthesizer is capable of producing basic waveforms such as sine, square, and triangle waves. Users can shape the sound using an ADSR envelope and modify the timbre with equalizer and resonator filters. The project features a graphical user interface for real-time interaction and sound adjustments.

## Features
- **Waveform Generation**: Generate sine, square, and triangle waveforms.
- **ADSR Envelope**: Control the dynamics of sounds with adjustable attack, decay, sustain, and release phases.
- **Filter Module**: Includes an equalizer for frequency-specific amplification and a resonator to emphasize certain frequencies.
- **Audio Output**: Processes the sound for playback through audio devices.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Real-time control over waveform selection, filter adjustments, and more.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- MATLAB R2023a or later.

### Clone the Repository
To get started with the synthesizer, clone this repository to your local machine using Git


Running the Project
Open MATLAB, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command to start the synthesizer: "Lydsignaler"

Usage
Once the synthesizer is running, use the graphical interface to:

Select the waveform type from the dropdown menu.
Adjust the ADSR sliders to shape the amplitude of the waveform.
Use the EQ sliders to boost or cut frequency bands.
Set the resonator frequency and bandwidth to modify the sound's resonance.
